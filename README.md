## This project was jointly completed by Ananya Purushottam, Zayyan Naveed, and Jad Bataha.

## To successfully run this application, first:
* Make sure you have Python 3 (3.10+ preferred) installed on your local machine. Python is installed on the Zoo for your convenience. That being said, setting up a website program on the Zoo might be a bit tedious, so we encourage you to have Python installed locally. See [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installing Python locally.
* Once you have Python installed, ensure you have the following libraries in your virtual environment (or globally if you so wish):
    * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/)
    * [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
    * We recommend using pip to install these, as that has worked for all of us. Pip comes preinstalled with Python. For more information on Pip, see [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
    * For the application to properly work, we kindly ask you to use *Google Chrome* instead of other browsers.
* And.. that's it! In your terminal, please navigate to the folder in which you have stored the application folder and execute the following (in your terminal):
`python3.10 app,py`, then head over to `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. After heading to the website, please answer all the questions asked.
* Alternatively, if you wish to avoid using Terminal commands, you could open the app.py in Visual Studio Code and click on "Run" or "Run without Debugging" option in the Menubar. Any other suitable IDE that you prefer to use should work as well!

After you answer *all* the questions, click "Check". This will promptly open a *new* Incognito Window, which will be populated with the SPASS data from your answer and automatically submit the populated file to WebSpass. 

Based on the information provided, you will either get a "Proof Found" message (meaning the government can electronically surveil you under FISA) or a "Completion Found" message (meaning the government can NOT electronically surveil you under FISA).
